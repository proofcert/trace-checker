<h1>AIM Instances</h1>


The following description is based on the original description from
Kazuo Iwama, Eiji Miyano and Yuichi Asahiro which is available <A
HREF="ftp://dimacs.rutgers.edu/pub/challenge/satisfiability/contributed/iwama/README.instances">here</a>
from the DIMACS ftp-site.<br><br>

The AIM instance are all generated with a particular Random-3-SAT
instance generator [AIM96]. The particularity is that the generator
yes-instances and no-instances independently for wide ranges. So its
primary role is to provide such instances that the conventional random
generation can hardly generate. The generator runs in a randomized
fashion, so that it essentially different from those generated in some
deterministic fashion or those translated from other problems.<br><br>

As a result, the following set of instances includes 
<UL>
<LI>(i) no-instances at low clause/variable ratios</LI>
<LI>(ii) yes-instances at low and high clause/variable ratios that however have
only one solution</LI>
</UL>


The instances are named as <i>aim-xxx-y_y-zzzz-j</i> where
<UL>
<LI><i>(i)</i> all the names have "aim" at the beginning (stands for Asahiro, Iwama
    and Miyano)</LI>
<LI><i>(ii)</i> next xxx shows the number of variables, one of 50, 100 and 200</LI>
<LI><i>(iii)</i> y_y shows the clause/variable ratio y.y, including 1.6, 2.0 for
      no-instances and 1.6, 2.0, 3.4 and 6.0 for single-solution yes-
      instances</LI>
<LI><i>(iv)</i> zzzz is "no" or "yes1", the former denoting a no-instance and the
     latter a single-solution yes-instance</LI>
<LI><i>(v)</i> the last j means simply the j-th instance at that parameter.</LI>
</UL>

For each parameter, four instances are included in the benchmark
set. for example, aim-100-2_0-no-1 through aim-100-2_0-no-4, are four
no-instances with 100 variables and 2.0 clause/variable ratio. In
total, there are 18 sets of instances with n = 50, 100, 200; for the
yes instances clause / variable ratios are taken from 1.6, 2.0, 3.4,
and 6.0; for the no instances they are taken from 1.6 and 2.0.<br><br>


<h4>Instance hardness</h4>

It should be noted that all the instances can be solved with
polynomial preprocessing (using binary failed literals). Therefore,
these instances cannot be considered as intrinsically hard and appear
not to be very good benchmark instances.<br><br>

Complete algorithms appear to perform very well on these instances. For
example, SATZ (version 41 from SATLIB) solves all the instances in at
most 2 backtracks. Nevertheless, some local search algorithms like the
algorithms based on the WalkSAT family and the GSAT variants, show a
very poor performance on the instances with low clause / variable
ratio; in particular for ratios 1.6 and 2.0. Yet, local search
algorithms using clause weighting schemes appear to solve these
instances quite easily [CI95]. Therefore, it would be interesting to
investigate the reasons for these facts. Possibly, it is due to very
large plateaus in the search space of the problems at low clause /
variable ratios.
